\title{Random binary vector}
\usage{
rbits(size, p = 0.5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{size}{The size of the vector. Can be a list of dimensions to create a vector, matrix or array. If a vector larger than 3 is provided, each value is treated as the probability of obtaining 1 and a vector of bits is generated using a binomial distribution.}

\item{p}{Probability of obtaining a 1. By default it's \code{0.5}.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments passed to matrix or array}
}
\value{
The generated binary vector
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around \link{sample} to generate binary vectors.
}
\examples{
## Unbiased probabilities
rbits(10)

## Biased probabilities
rbits(10, p = 0.8)

## Matrix of bits
rbits(c(3, 4))

## 3D Array of bits
rbits(c(3, 4, 2))
