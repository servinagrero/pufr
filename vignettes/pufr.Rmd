# Physical Unclonable Functions

Physical Unclonable Functions, commonly knows as PUFs, are a mechanism that leverages the manufacture variability of devices to generate secrets.

A PUF is interrogated by means of a `challenge` and it returns a `response`, normally a bit. A challenge and its corresponding response are called Challenge Response Pair(CRP). The set of all CRPs of a physical device is different from all CRPs of a different device.


## Getting started

This library can make use of `parallel` to make the computations faster. If the packet is installed, it is loaded and a context is created automatically.

```{r setup}
library(pufr)
```
